These networks provide a structured way to represent variables and their probabilistic relationships, allowing us to update our beliefs as new evidence emerges.\n",

    "To make these models come to life, we will use pgmpy, a Python library for working with probabilistic graphical models. With it, you'll encode the relationships between observable traits (like rough hands or posture) and hidden variables (like occupation or marital status). You'll then use inference algorithms to compute the most probable explanations behind a character’s appearance or behavior."
